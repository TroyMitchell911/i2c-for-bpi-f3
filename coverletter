riscv: spacemit: add i2c support to k1 SoC

Hi all,

This patch implements I2C driver for the SpacemiT K1 SoC,
providing basic support for I2C read/write communication which
compatible with standard I2C bus specifications.

The docs of I2C can be found here, in chapter 16.1 I2C [1]

Future work may include adding DMA support and fast-mode support
of the driver.
